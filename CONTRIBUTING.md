# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, or through Discord.

## Requirements on additions.

Every additional feature requires at least one MEANINGFUL test written, if applicable. 
If the addition is major, as in having several features and functions that works together, at least one integration test is required.
If the functionality required changes to existing functions, you're obligated to make sure tests for those functions pass, and update tests if not.


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure the Pull Request follows the specifications that was originally detailed in the related issue. If additional features/additions are included, specify them clearly in the Pull request.
2. Pull Requests have to specify what's changed, added, and removed in an overarching detail. If some functionalities are not working as expected due to the changes, specify those and the reasoning why, as well as an evaluation of the consequences of allowing them to remain.
3. If applicable, include pictures displaying the changes.

Pull requests may be reviewed by several people, but only merged after an administrator for the repository accepts it.
