# Currently planned features and additions


### Ability to view guides written by legitimate people
Articles. Should be flexible to handle categories, sub categories, and allow for react componentes to be parsed in a intuitive manner.

### Build suggestions
A way to get recommendations for your build based on selected collection.
Will most likely be extremely rough and unreliable for many cases, but will probably use pre-defined weights and collections of relations with a lot of configurations to direct a build torwards a build.
First step would be directly removing bad runes/skills/companions and replacing it according to a list of generic things that are upgrades.
